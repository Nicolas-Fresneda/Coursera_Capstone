For this task, you can go to a finance specialist, who will allow you to do a market study and determine all these factors and the most favorable for you, after a considerable time. However, if you do not have that time, if you need to place your restaurant as soon as possible, so that it generates profits, you should go with a person who has good experience with data management, in addition, who can provide you with a answer and a solution to your problem, in a much shorter time."
